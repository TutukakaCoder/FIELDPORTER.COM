## "The Operator Building AI Solutions"

## WHO I AM

Frederick Hopkins, Founder of FIELDPORTER. I build AI systems for my own
businesses while consulting with enterprises. When I recommend something, it's
because I've already built it and know it works.

**Key Point**: I'm not a traditional consultant. I'm actively building
AI-powered businesses right now.

## WHAT MAKES ME DIFFERENT

### 1. **I Build What I Recommend**

When I tell clients to implement an AI system, it's because I've built similar
systems myself and know the real challenges.

### 2. **Current Operational Experience**

I'm not talking about projects from 5 years ago. I'm building AI businesses
right now, dealing with current challenges.

### 3. **Real Implementation Knowledge**

I know what actually works vs. what sounds good in theory because I've
implemented these systems myself.

### 4. **Honest About Failures**

I've had projects fail and learned from them. That experience helps clients
avoid similar mistakes.

## MY APPROACH

1. **Start Small**: Prove concepts work before scaling
2. **Measure Everything**: Track real metrics, not vanity numbers
3. **Plan for Failure**: Build systems that degrade gracefully
4. **Focus on Users**: Technology serves people, not the other way around
5. **Stay Realistic**: Honest about what AI can and can't do

This is who I am: someone building AI businesses while helping others do the
same. No inflated claims, just real experience from actual implementation.
