# Service Descriptions
- "I build working prototypes that prove concepts..."
+ "We build working prototypes that prove concepts..."

### **2. METHODOLOGY SECTION - COMPLETELY REBUILT** ✅

**Problem**: Boring accordion dropdowns with consultant jargon walls of text
**Solution**: Interactive horizontal scroll with visual phase cards

#### **Before vs After**:

```diff
# OLD: Boring accordion with jargon
- Expandable deliverables lists with consultant-speak
- "Complete business context mapping and documentation"
- "Strategic objectives analysis and priority framework"
- "Intelligence extraction from bulk research volumes"

# NEW: Interactive visual cards with simple language
+ "Feed Your Context" - AI learns your business in 2 hours
+ "AI Heavy Lifting" - 1000 sources analyzed overnight
+ "Cut the Noise" - Only insights that matter
+ "Triple Check" - 3 AI models verify accuracy
+ "Ready to Use" - Board-ready insights, not data
```

#### **New Interactive Features**:

- **Horizontal scroll**: Premium mobile-first experience
- **Hover animations**: Cards reveal time savings and examples
- **Visual hierarchy**: Large phase numbers, gradient icons
- **Real metrics**: "€50k research → €50", "500 pages → 5 decisions"
- **Scroll hints**: Subtle animation guides user interaction

### **3. CONSULTANT JARGON - COMPLETELY ELIMINATED** ✅

**Problem**: Walls of meaningless consultant-speak
**Solution**: Simple, clear language that shows AI value

#### **Jargon Purged**:

```diff
- "Strategic frameworks and decision-making tools"
+ "Clear business recommendations"

- "Systematic methodology applied to specific business challenges"
+ "AI-powered solutions applied to specific business challenges"

- "Intelligence extraction from bulk research volumes"
+ "AI filters out everything irrelevant"

- "Cross-model validation for accuracy and consistency verification"
+ "3 AI models verify accuracy"

- "Strategic documentation and implementation roadmaps"
+ "Board-ready insights, not data"
```

### **4. FAQ SECTION - COMPLETELY REWRITTEN** ✅

**Problem**: Overly complex consultant-speak answers
**Solution**: Clear, actionable answers under 4 sentences each

#### **FAQ Transformation Examples**:

```diff
# Question: Timeline expectations
- "Our systematic methodology allows us to prototype AI features within 1-3 weeks typically. We process requirements rapidly and focus on proving concepts quickly rather than lengthy development cycles."

+ "Most AI prototypes are delivered within 1-3 weeks. Week 1: We understand your process. Week 2: AI agents are trained and tested. Week 3: Working prototype with integration documentation. Faster than hiring, more focused than consultants."

# Question: Service scope
- "We focus on prototyping AI features with complete technical documentation that proves concepts. We can integrate these via API endpoints and provide clear implementation roadmaps for your existing systems, but we are not interested in full platform development - just the AI components."

+ "We specialize in AI feature prototyping and integration roadmaps. Our sweet spot is proving AI concepts work for your specific use case in 1-3 weeks, then providing clear documentation for your team to implement. Think of us as your AI R&D department."
