## 🔧 **FAQ Section Enhancement**

### **Improved Clarity & Business Focus**

**Transformation Philosophy**: From consultant-speak to clear, actionable answers

#### **FAQ #1: Service Scope Clarification**

```diff
- 'We focus on prototyping AI features with complete technical documentation that proves concepts. We can integrate these via API endpoints and provide clear implementation roadmaps for your existing systems, but we are not interested in full platform development - just the AI components.'

+ 'We specialize in AI feature prototyping and integration roadmaps. Our sweet spot is proving AI concepts work for your specific use case in 1-3 weeks, then providing clear documentation for your team to implement. Think of us as your AI R&D department.'
```

#### **FAQ #2: Timeline Expectations**

```diff
- 'Our systematic methodology allows us to prototype AI features within 1-3 weeks typically. We process requirements rapidly and focus on proving concepts quickly rather than lengthy development cycles.'

+ 'Most AI prototypes are delivered within 1-3 weeks. Week 1: We understand your process. Week 2: AI agents are trained and tested. Week 3: Working prototype with integration documentation. Faster than hiring, more focused than consultants.'
```

#### **FAQ #3: Deliverables Clarity**

```diff
- 'You receive working prototypes, complete API documentation, integration guides, and technical specifications. Your team can then implement these into your existing systems, or we can provide guidance during the integration process.'

+ 'You get: 1) Working prototype code, 2) Integration documentation, 3) Training for your team, 4) 30-day support for questions. Most clients either implement themselves or use our integration roadmap with their existing developers.'
```

#### **FAQ #4: Tool Selection Simplified**

```diff
- 'We use whatever combination delivers optimal results for your specific use case - Claude for contextual understanding, Gemini for deep research, DeepSeek for cost-effective processing. The choice depends on your requirements and budget constraints.'

+ 'We match tools to your specific needs. Claude for complex reasoning, GPT-4 for general tasks, DeepSeek for cost efficiency, open-source models for privacy. No vendor lock-in - we recommend what works best for you.'
