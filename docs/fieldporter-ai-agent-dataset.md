## WHAT WE CAN DO FOR YOU

### 🤖 Making Businesses Smarter with AI

We believe AI can be a powerful force for efficiency and insight when applied
correctly. We focus on building AI tools that are practical and deliver value:

**Supercharging Research**: We've designed systems using advanced AI like Claude
and Gemini to slash market research time from weeks down to just a few hours.
This gives businesses "McKinsey-level insights at Silicon Valley speed," helping
them understand markets, spot trends, and make faster, data-driven decisions.
We've applied this to help VCs find investment opportunities and entrepreneurs
plan their growth.

**Automating Sales & Marketing**: We built an AI-powered system that replaced an
expensive lead generation service. It finds potential customers, manages email
outreach, and intelligently understands replies, classifying them as
'interested' or 'needs follow-up'. This saved our client over 50% in costs and
15+ hours of manual work weekly.

**Improving Meetings & Workflows**: We've developed AI tools that automatically
transcribe meetings, extract key actions, and even analyze sentiment. This
significantly reduces manual note-taking (by up to 40%) and provides insights
into team dynamics.

**Enhancing User Experience**: For investment platforms, we integrate AI to
provide intelligent news summaries, helping users digest information faster. We
also focus heavily on cost control, ensuring these AI features are affordable,
reducing potential API costs by 60-70% through smart design.

**Building AI-Powered Businesses**: We've gone beyond just adding AI features;
we design entire business models around AI, including AI agent systems and
automation workflows.

### 🛠️ Building & Scaling Software Products

From initial ideas to fully fledged platforms, we have hands-on experience
building and managing software development:

**Developing Software Suites**: We've led the development of multiple
software-as-a-service (SaaS) products simultaneously, covering areas like board
management, sales, and property management. This involves using modern
technologies like React, Next.js, and Firebase to build robust and user-friendly
applications.

**Rapid Prototyping & MVPs**: We understand the importance of building and
testing ideas quickly. We created a high-end, Porsche-branded feedback app in
just one week, using AI tools to speed up development. We focus on building
Minimum Viable Products (MVPs), simplifying complex ideas into core, deliverable
features to get to market faster.

**Enterprise-Grade Systems**: We've built large-scale performance management
systems used by over 2,100 staff across the globe. This involved complex
database work and ensuring the platform was reliable and secure for major
corporations.

**Fixing & Enhancing Existing Systems**: We often jump into projects to solve
critical problems. For VOYCAP, we replaced an unreliable system and fixed a
major bug where images wouldn't display (achieving 85-90% success). We do this
quickly, within existing technology constraints, demonstrating our ability to
adapt and deliver under pressure.

**Building the AI 'Engine Room'**: We've developed high-performance systems
specifically designed to run large AI models efficiently, making them much
faster (up to 10x) and cheaper to operate.

### 📈 Driving Business Strategy & Growth

Technology is a tool; the goal is business success. We bring a strategic mindset
to every project:

**Growth Planning**: For the fashion brand SIR The Label, we developed a
comprehensive strategy to help them triple their revenue to $75M+. This wasn't
just tech; it covered pricing, product ranges, wholesale partnerships, and
supply chains, projecting a nearly 9x return on their investment.

**Market Analysis & Positioning**: We help businesses understand where they fit
and how to win. We've developed deep analysis frameworks for multi-billion
dollar markets in EdTech, sustainability, and robotics. For MyIndustry Hub, our
analysis helped them pivot from government work to enterprise sales, identifying
a $10.5M opportunity pipeline.

**Technology Roadmaps**: We help businesses choose the _right_ technology. This
means assessing different systems and recommending the best fit for your
specific needs and budget.

### 🔗 Integrating Systems & Automating Processes

Efficiency often comes from making different systems work together seamlessly
and automating repetitive tasks:

**Connecting the Dots**: We've integrated Point-of-Sale (POS) systems with
membership databases and accounting software for clubs, eliminating manual data
entry and errors. We focus on API-first designs, making it easier for systems to
communicate.

**Workflow Automation**: We've designed systems like FamilyLink, which uses AI
and workflow tools to automatically route messages and tasks, saving families
hours of coordination time.

**Improving Efficiency**: We specialize in automating performance tracking,
reporting, and manual processes that eat up valuable time.
